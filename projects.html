                <h2>Machine Learning Model for Video Game Ratings</h2>
                <p>In this project, I created a machine learning model to analyze trends in video game ratings. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and PyTorch, I cleaned and preprocessed raw data, engineered features, and visualized insights. This project taught me how to uncover patterns in data and communicate findings effectively through visualizations. It also reinforced the importance of data quality and thoughtful feature selection in building accurate models. The process of iterating on the model to improve its performance was both challenging and rewarding. I am currently working on extending this project to recommend games for a user based on their preferences and past ratings.</p>

                <h2>Honors College Thesis: Zero-Knowledge Proofs</h2>
                <p>For my Honors College thesis, I delved into the fascinating world of zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic method that allows one party to prove knowledge of a fact without revealing the fact itself. Using Python and the NetworkX library, I designed and simulated real-world authentication scenarios to explore secure data transmission methods. This project not only deepened my understanding of cryptographic protocols but also taught me how to approach complex problems analytically. The experience of writing and presenting my thesis was invaluable in refining my technical communication skills.

                <h2>Machine Learning Research</h2>
                <p>In this project, I explored machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees. My focus was on understanding the entire pipeline, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model evaluation. Working in Google Colab, I applied these models to real-world datasets, learning how to clean and normalize data, select meaningful features, and evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score. This hands-on experience gave me a solid foundation in machine learning and taught me how to approach data-driven problems systematically.</p>

                <h2>2D Platform Fighter Video Game</h2>
                <p>As part of a team, I worked on developing a 2D platform fighter game over six months using agile methodologies. My role involved designing game mechanics and collaborating on feature integration. I learned how to handle challenges like collision detection and character movement while ensuring smooth gameplay. This project was a great opportunity to improve my teamwork and problem-solving skills, as well as to experience the iterative process of game development. Seeing the final product come together was incredibly rewarding.</p>

                <h2>Speedrunning Game with Java and Multithreading</h2>
                <p>For this project, I developed a speedrunning game that tracked player times using a multithreaded Java system. The game featured real-time updates for player performance, including current times, fastest records, and new achievements. Implementing multithreading was a challenging but rewarding experience, as it required careful synchronization to ensure smooth gameplay. This project helped me strengthen my Java programming skills and taught me how to design systems that handle concurrent tasks efficiently.</p>

                <h2>Incident Reports Website</h2>
                <p>This project involved building a web-based incident reporting system with PHP and SQL for the backend. The system allowed users to log, retrieve, and analyze reports securely. I designed a database schema to store incident data and implemented input validation to ensure data integrity. Developing the user interface taught me how to create intuitive and user-friendly designs, while working on the backend reinforced my understanding of database management and secure data handling. This project was a great opportunity to apply full-stack development skills to solve a real-world problem.</p>
